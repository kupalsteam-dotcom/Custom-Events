element.addEventListener(eventName, handler)

Real-Life Examples

Toast Notification for Editing User Profile

Suppose you want to notify users with a toast (notification popup) whenever they update their profile information (e.g. name, email, or password).

You can trigger a custom event like show-toast with a success or error message after the form submission, and a centralized toast handler will listen for this event and display the message on screen.
